                    The Illuminati supports the positive efforts of this planetâ€™s elite and the initiative of the Giving Pledge. Originally conceived by Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett, the Giving Pledge encourages those with much to consider the needs of those with less.
                    <br/><br/>
                    By taking the Giving Pledge, wealthy members of the human species promise to donate the majority of their monetary worth to charitable causes that support positive changes in the lives of those who need it.

                <p className="about-symbols-mid__del--foot">
                    The Giving Pledge is intended for billionaires or those who would be billionaires if not for their donations to charity. The Illuminati is not directly affiliated with this charity and cannot accept donations of any kind.
