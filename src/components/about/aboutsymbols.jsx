                    Symbols of the Illuminati appear in thousands of locations across this planet: on currency, architecture, artwork, and in media of all kinds. Since our formation, many of the Illuminatiâ€™s symbols have been shrouded in mystery, which has led to confusion over their meanings and purpose. In this section of our public website, our organization will bring clarity to our symbols and offer insights into their true interpretations.
